          <img id="profile" src="./images/profile.jpg" class="img-rounded float-left">

          <p class="text-md-left">I was born in Provo, Utah and raised in a small mountian town in Washington State named North Bend in the Pacific
            North West. I spent most my time in the Cascade Mountains like they were a second home. When I was not enjoying
            the outdoors, I was playing sports: cross-country, wrestling, soccer, baseball.</p>

          <p class="text-md-left">I competed in varsity sports all four years of high school, earning my varsity letter as a freshman in wrestling.
            I competed and placed in state wrestling in both my junior and senior years. I still hold many school records
            to this day.</p>

          <p class="text-md-left">After high School, I attended Utah Valley University and earned a bachelor's degree in accounting. While studying
            at UVU, I meet my wife, Desiree; we've been married six years this May. We have two children, Augustus and Penelopy,
            and one more girl on the way.</p>

          <p class="text-md-left">I enjoy many hobbies (too many if you ask my wife). I enjoy gardening, bee keeping, building and remodeling things
            around the house and many other DIY activities. I also enjoy cycling and mountian biking when I have the time.</p>

          <p class="text-md-left">I currently work as the operations manager and DDM Racing, an ecommerse site specializing in large scale RC products.
            Working at a small business gives me the opportunity to work in many different roles within the company. It is
            there that I discovered a new interest in web development. I managed the development of our new website and became
            very interested in learning programming myself. After several months of self-learning I decided to enroll in
            the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I'm very excited to learn more and broaden my skills, making myself move
            marketable.
